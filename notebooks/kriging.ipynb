    "# Kriging\n",
    "\n",
    "Kriging is **\"a collection of gneralized linear regression techniques for minimizing an estimation variance defined from a priori model for a convariance\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the estimate of an unsampled value $z(\\mathbf{u})$ from neighboring data values $z({\\mathbf{u}}_{\\alpha}),\\alpha=1,\\dots,n$. The RF model $Z(\\mathbf{u})$ is stationary with mean $m$ and covariance $C(\\mathbf{h})$. In its simplest form, also known as **Simple Kriging (SK)**, the algorithm considers the following linear estimator:\n",
    "$${Z}_{SK}^{*}(\\mathbf{u})=\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}{\\lambda}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{u})Z({\\mathbf{u}}_{\\alpha})+\\left(1-\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}{\\lambda}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{u})\\right)m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights ${\\lambda}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{u})$ are determined to minnimize the error variance, also called the \"estimation variance.\" That minimization results in a set of normal equations:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{\\beta=1}^{n}{\\lambda}_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{u})C({\\mathbf{u}}_{\\beta}-{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\alpha})=C(\\mathbf{u}-{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\alpha})\\\\\n",
    "\\forall{\\alpha}=1,\\dots,n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding minimized estimation variance, or kriging variance, is:\n",
    "$${\\sigma}_{SK}^{2}(\\mathbf{u})=C(0)-\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}{\\lambda}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{u})C(\\mathbf{u}-{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\alpha})\\geq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary Kriging (OK)** is the most commonly used variant of the previous simple kriging algorithm, whereby the sum of the weights $\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}{\\lambda}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{u})$ is considered to equal 1. This allows building an estimator $Z_{OK}^{*}(\\mathbf{u})$ that does not require prior knowledge of the stationary mean m, yet remains unbiased in the sense that $E\\{{Z}_{OK}^{*}(\\mathbf{u})\\}=E\\{Z(\\mathbf{u})\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**None-linear kriging** is but linear kriging performed on some non-linear transform of the z-data, e.g., the **log-transform** $\\mathrm{ln}z$ privided that $z>0$, or the **indicator transform** as defined in relation:\n",
    "$$I(\\mathbf{u};z)=\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1,\\quad Z(\\mathbf{u})\\leq z\\\\\n",
    "0,\\quad \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, kriging (**SK** or **OK**) has been performed to provide a \"best\" linear unbiased estimate (**BLUE**) for unsampled values $z(\\mathbf{u})$, with the kriging variance being used to define Gaussian-type confidence intervals, e.g.,\n",
    "$$\\text{Prob}\\{Z(\\mathbf{u})\\in [{z}_{SK}^{*}(\\mathbf{u})\\pm 2{\\sigma}_{SK}(\\mathbf{u})]\\cong 0.95\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unfortunately, kriging variances of the type, being independent of the data values, only provides a comparison of alternative geometric data configurations. Kriging variances are usually not measures of local estimation accuracy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The kriging algorithm has two characteristic properties that allow its use in determining **posterior ccdfs**. These two characteristic properties are the basis for, respectively, the **multi-Gaussian (MG) approach** and the **indicator kriging (IK) approach** to determination of ccdfs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Multi-Gaussian Approach: If the RF model $Z(\\mathbf{u})$ is multivariate Gaussian, then the simple kriging estimate and variance identify the mean and variance of the posterior ccdf. In addition, since that ccdf is Gaussian, it is fully determined by these two parameters. This remarkable result is at the basis of multi-Gaussian (MG) kriging and simulation. The MG approach is said to be **parametric** in the sense that it determines the ccdfs through their parameters (mean and variance). The MG algorithm is remarkably fast and trouble-free; its limitation is the reliance on the very specific and sometimes inappropriate properties fo the Gaussian RF model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Indicator Kriging Approach: If the value to be estimated is the expected value (mean) of a distribution, then least-squares (LS) regression (i.e., kriging) is a priori the prefered algorithm. The reason is that the LS estimator fo the variable $Z(\\mathbf{u})$ is also the LS estimator fo its conditional expectation $E\\{Z(\\mathbf{u})\\mid(n)\\}$, that is, of the expected value of the ccdf. Instead of the variable $Z(\\mathbf{u})$, consider its binary indicator transform $I(\\mathbf{u};z)$. Kriging of the indicator RV $I(\\mathbf{u};z)$ provides an estimate that is also the best LS estimate fo the conditional expectation of $I(\\mathbf{u};z)$. Now, the conditional expecation of $I(\\mathbf{u};z)$ is equal to the ccdf of $Z(\\mathbf{u})$; indeed:\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "E\\{I(\\mathbf{u};z)\\mid (n)\\}&=\n",
    "\\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "1\\cdot \\text{Prob}\\{I(\\mathbf{u};z)=1\\mid (n)\\}\\\\\n",
    "+0\\cdot \\text{Prob}\\{I(\\mathbf{u};z)=0\\mid (n)\\}\n",
    "\\end{array}\\\\\n",
    "&=1\\cdot \\text{Prob}\\{Z(\\mathbf{u})\\leq z\\mid (n)\\}\\\\\\\n",
    "&\\equiv F(\\mathbf{u};z\\mid (n))\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "Thus the kriging algorithm applied to indicator data provides LS estimates of the ccdf. Note that indicator kriging (IK) is not aimed at estimating the unsampled value $z(\\mathbf{u})$ or its indicator transform $I(\\mathbf{u};z)$ but at providing a ccdf model of uncertainty about $z(\\mathbf{u})$. The IK algorithm is said to be **non-parametric** in the sense that is does not approach the ccdf through its parameters (mean and variance); rather, the ccdf values for various threshold values $z$ are estimated directly."

The other functions are typically monomials of low degree in the cooridinates of x (in practice, the degree does not exceed two). In the case of monomials, the superscript $\\mathscr{l}$, which is an index, has the meaning of a power (in 1D, ${f}^{\\mathscr{l}}(x)={x}^{\\mathscr{l}}$).
