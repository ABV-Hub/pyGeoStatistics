    "## Universal Kriging (UK) or Kriging with a Trend Model (KT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general model, which Matheron(1969) named the *universal kriging* model for reasons explained below, assumes that the mean function can be represented as a reponse surface function\n",

    "$$m(x)=\\sum\\limits_{\\mathscr{l}=0}^{L}{{a}_{\\mathscr{l}}{f}^{\\mathscr{l}}(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the ${f}^{\\mathscr{l}}(x)$ are kown basis functions and ${a}_{\\mathscr{l}}$ are fixed but unknown coefficients. Usually the first basis function (case $\\mathscr{l}=0$) is the constant function identically equal to 1, which guarantees that the constant-mean case is included in the model. The other functions are typically monomials of low degree in the cooridinates of x (in practice, the degree does not exceed two). In the case of monomials, the superscript $\\mathscr{l}$, which is an index, has the meaning of a power (in 1D, ${f}^{\\mathscr{l}}(x)={x}^{\\mathscr{l}}$). Note that the above function may be regarded as a local approximation to $m(x)$; that is, the coefficients ${a}_{\\mathscr{l}}$ may vary in space but sufficiently slowly to be considered constant within estimation neighborhoods.\n",

Note that the drift refers to a technically precise notion (the mean of the RF $Z$), whereas *trend* is a generic term designating a general tendency, a systematic effect (besides, \"trend\" may imply an underlying driving force). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to minimize $E{({Z}^{*}-{Z}_{0})}^{2}$, we have to make ${[E({Z}^{*}-{Z}_{0})]}^{2}$ zero whatever the unknown coefficients ${a}_{\\mathscr{l}}$, which implies annihilating their factors in the above. This leads to the set of L+1 conditions\n",
